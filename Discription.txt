MQ2 Gas Sensor:-
It Operates on +5V DC and gives analog output voltage: 0V to 5V
It is used to Measure or detect LPG, Alcohol, Propane, Hydrogen, CO and even methane. It requires Preheat duration for 20 seconds
When the concentration of gas > 280, Green LED will Glow showing that there is an harmfull Gas or Smoke in the Dustbin
pin 1(VCC) is connected to 5V supply
pin 2(GND) is connected to Ground
pin 3(DO) Not connected
pin 4(AO) is connected to Analog input pin(A1) of Arduino

PIR Sensor:-
A passive infrared sensor is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view.
It works with +5V to +12V DC supply.It has 2 adjustment knobs, sensitivity and time delay.
When a human will be detected near the dustbin, the door of the dustbin will get open by the help of stepper motor and Blue LED gets ON.  
pin 1(VCC) is connected to 5V supply
pin 2(DO) is connected to Digital Input pin(D13) of Arduino
pin 3(GND) is connected to Ground

Ultrasonic Sensor:-
This HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor provides 2cm to 400cm of non-contact measurement.
It will indicate "FULL(Red LED ON)" when the distance of waste is less than 26cm  
pin 1(VCC) is connected to 5V supply
pin 2(TRIG) is connected to Digital Input pin(D3) of Arduino
pin 3(ECHO) is connected to Digital Input pin(D2) of Arduino
pin 4(GND) is connected to Ground

Stepper Motor:-
A stepper motor is an electric motor whose main feature is that its shaft rotates by performing steps, that is, by moving by a fixed amount of degrees.
It Operates on +5V DC supply, and requires additional motor driver IC(ULN2003).As the PIR Sensor Sense the human it ON's Stepper Motor to open the door.
