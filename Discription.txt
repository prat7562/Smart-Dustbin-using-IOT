MQ2 Gas Sensor:-
It Operates on +5V DC and gives analog output voltage: 0V to 5V
It is used to Measure or detect LPG, Alcohol, Propane, Hydrogen, CO and even methane. It requires Preheat duration for 20 seconds
When the concentration of gas > 238, Red LED will Glow showing that there is an harmfull Gas or Smoke in the Dustbin
pin 1(VCC) is connected to 5V supply
pin 2(GND) is connected to Ground
pin 3(DO) Not connected
pin 4(AO) is connected to Analog input pin(A0) of NodeMcu

PIR Sensor:-
A passive infrared sensor is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view.
It works with +5V to +12V DC supply.It has 2 adjustment knobs, sensitivity and time delay.
When a human will be detected near the dustbin, the door of the dustbin will get open by the help of Servo motor.  
pin 1(VCC) is connected to 5V supply
pin 2(DO) is connected to Digital Input pin(D0) of NodeMcu
pin 3(GND) is connected to Ground

Ultrasonic Sensor 1:-
This HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor provides 2cm to 400cm of non-contact measurement.
It will indicate "FULL(Red LED ON)" when the distance of waste is less than 26cm  
pin 1(VCC) is connected to 5V supply
pin 2(TRIG) is connected to Digital Input pin(D3) of NodeMcu
pin 3(ECHO) is connected to Digital Input pin(D4) of NodeMcu
pin 4(GND) is connected to Ground

Ultrasonic Sensor 2:-
This HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor provides 2cm to 400cm of non-contact measurement.
It will indicate "FULL(Red LED ON)" when the distance of waste is less than 26cm  
pin 1(VCC) is connected to 5V supply
pin 2(TRIG) is connected to Digital Input pin(D5) of NodeMcu
pin 3(ECHO) is connected to Digital Input pin(D6) of NodeMcu
pin 4(GND) is connected to Ground

Servo Motor 1:-
A servo motor is an electric motor whose main feature is that its shaft rotates by performing steps, that is, by moving by a fixed amount of degrees.
It Operates on +5V DC supply.As the PIR Sensor Sense the human it ON's Servo Motor to open the door.

D1           Input

Servo Motor 2:-
A servo motor is an electric motor whose main feature is that its shaft rotates by performing steps, that is, by moving by a fixed amount of degrees.
It Operates on +5V DC supply.As the PIR Sensor Sense the waste it tilts Servo Motor to wet or dry bin accordingly.
